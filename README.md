## Going forward
To whome it may concern. The script developed for this project is versitile and modifyable, but most importantly works as-is
Two suggestions for some suggestions for optimization are: 
- Fix the counting script so it displays more cleanly in the terminal. The numbers are all right, but difficult to read
- Additionally, canning the code and running it from a terminal or as a macro would reduce the possibility for the script being changed by accedent or having typos introduced.
